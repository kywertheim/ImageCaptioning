# ImageCaptioning

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

The Jupyter notebooks present the procedures I followed to build an image captioning AI system. Notebook zero introduces you to the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset. Notebook one records the procedures I followed to build a data loader, a CNN to encode images, and an RNN to decode encoded images to generate captions. Notebook two is about model training. Notebook three presents four sets of captions the trained model produced.

Due to its large size, the directory titled models is not in this repository. It contains the trained encoder and decoder models.
